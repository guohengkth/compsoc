##
## shared memory allocation for this vep
## - the starting addresses are RELATIVE to the start of the shared memory
## - (no need to add 0x800[23]0000)
## - you can use K for 1024 and hex or decimal
## - size & address must use the same format (hex/dec no/K)
## - use /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-size [-A] *.elf
##   to analyse a partition's memory usage
## - it's recommended to use shared/vep.h to manage this memory
##
# this VEP uses no shared memories
##
## memory and stack allocation for each partition
## - per tile the system application with 32K is always added
## - 8K, 16K, 32K, or 64K per partition
## - max 128K per tile
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 32K
on tile 0 partition 2 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 64K
on tile 0 partition 3 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 96K
on tile 1 partition 1 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 32K
on tile 1 partition 2 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 64K
on tile 1 partition 3 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 96K
on tile 2 partition 1 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 32K
on tile 2 partition 2 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 64K
on tile 2 partition 3 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 96K
##
## schedule for partitions that have a memory allocation
## - the same length of slot table must be given for all slots
## - max 32 slots per tile
## - a partition can have more than one slot
## - slots are separated by VKERNEL slots of 2000 cycles
## - the system partition uses cycles 0-5000, thus first app slot starts at 7000
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 10100 cycles of 43600 starting at  7000
on tile 0 partition 2 has 10200 cycles of 43600 starting at 19100
on tile 0 partition 3 has 10300 cycles of 43600 starting at 31300
on tile 1 partition 1 has 10600 cycles of 43600 starting at 7000
on tile 1 partition 2 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at 19600
on tile 1 partition 3 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at 31600
on tile 2 partition 1 has 10600 cycles of 43600 starting at  7000
on tile 2 partition 2 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at 19600
on tile 2 partition 3 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at 31600
